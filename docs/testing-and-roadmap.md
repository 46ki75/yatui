# Testing And Roadmap

## Testing Principles

- Test semantic structures before encoded terminal bytes.
- Keep a simple reference implementation for optimized algorithms.
- Make Unicode and lifecycle failures reproducible without a physical terminal
  where possible.
- Use PTY tests for behavior that mocks cannot represent.
- Treat terminal restoration as correctness, not cleanup polish.
- Track end-to-end latency and bytes emitted, not only microbenchmark throughput.

## Property And Fuzz Tests

Required properties include:

```text
replay(diff(current, next), current) == next
```

```text
decode(encode(valid terminal operation stream)) preserves semantics
```

```text
apply(edit sequence, simple String model) == apply(edit sequence, TextBuffer)
```

```text
undo(all edits) restores initial text and cursor state
```

Fuzz targets include:

- Arbitrary UTF-8 insertion, deletion, and movement
- Random buffer writes and overlapping graphemes
- Random surface composition
- Fragmented terminal byte streams
- Random retained tree insertion and removal
- Resize storms
- Output failures at every byte boundary

Fuzz regressions become permanent named tests.

The initial `cargo-fuzz` suite is isolated in `fuzz/` and currently includes:

- `text_edit_sequences` for bounded Unicode edit, movement, and selection
  sequences
- `render_transactions` for patch replay, commit, discard, resize, clipping,
  invalidation, and width-policy changes

Intentional corpus seeds are checked in. Pull requests, main-branch changes,
and a weekly schedule run the targets with a pinned nightly toolchain.

## Headless Test API

`arborui-test` exposes an application-level harness:

```rust
let mut app = TestApp::new(MyApp::default(), Size::new(80, 24));

app.key(KeyCode::Enter);
app.click(Point::new(10, 4));
app.resize(Size::new(100, 30));

insta::assert_snapshot!("submitted", app.frame());
assert_eq!(app.focused_key(), Some(Key::from("submit")));
```

The harness supports:

- Character snapshots
- Styled-cell snapshots
- Frame patch snapshots
- Normalized event injection
- Resize simulation
- Deterministic clocks
- Command completion
- Waiting until visual idle
- Focus and hit-map inspection
- Simulated backpressure and output failure

Snapshots are a supplement to structural assertions, not a replacement for
them.

### Snapshot Testing Rules

Add a snapshot when a feature or bug fix introduces a materially distinct,
deterministic visual state. Prefer snapshots for complete frames whose layout,
text, clipping, scrolling, or Unicode behavior would be difficult to review as
an inline string. Do not use snapshots for model logic, single values, every
intermediate key press, nondeterministic output, or large combinatorial state
matrices.

Use the narrowest representation that covers the contract:

- Character snapshots are the default for visible application behavior.
- Styled-cell snapshots are reserved for color, modifiers, focus indication,
  and cursor styling.
- Frame-patch snapshots are reserved for renderer transactions and performance
  contracts.
- Structural assertions cover model state, focus identity, hit testing, cursor
  coordinates, and event behavior.

Each application or substantial widget should normally have one initial-state
snapshot, one for each materially distinct visual state, and a relevant
boundary state such as empty, overflow, narrow viewport, or Unicode. Avoid
snapshots that differ only by an unimportant character.

Every snapshot test must use an explicit terminal size, deterministic time and
input, a stable explicit name, and public setup APIs. Include a semantic
assertion that explains why the state matters, and snapshot only after the
application reaches visual idle.

Snapshot files are committed and reviewed like source. Intentional visual
changes update their snapshots in the same pull request. Unexpected changes
require an implementation fix rather than blind acceptance. CI sets
`INSTA_UPDATE=no`, and generated `.snap.new` files are never committed. Install
the matching review tool and inspect pending snapshots locally with:

```console
cargo install cargo-insta --version 1.48.0 --locked
just snapshot-review
```

## PTY Integration Tests

PTY tests cover behavior that requires an operating system terminal:

- Raw mode activation and restoration
- Alternate-screen entry and exit
- Cursor restoration
- Panic cleanup
- Child-process suspension
- Unix stop and continue
- Resize signals
- Partial writes and closed output
- Main-screen scrolling
- Last-column and autowrap behavior

Target environments:

| Environment | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Linux PTY | Primary CI behavior |
| macOS PTY | BSD terminal and signal differences |
| Windows ConPTY | Windows input and output behavior |
| tmux | Multiplexer capability and wrapping behavior |
| xterm-compatible emulator | Baseline VT behavior |
| Slow memory or pipe sink | Backpressure and ordered output |

Not every emulator needs to run on every change. A smaller gating matrix and a
larger scheduled compatibility matrix are acceptable.

The gating matrix runs the process-isolated Crossterm lifecycle test on Linux
PTY, macOS PTY, and Windows ConPTY. Linux additionally verifies exact termios
restoration. Emulator semantics, tmux, Unix job-control signals, and termination
signals remain explicit stabilization follow-ups.

## Benchmarks

Benchmark fixtures should represent applications, not only isolated loops.

### Rendering Scenarios

- One changed cell in an 80 by 24 frame
- One changed cell in a 240 by 80 frame
- Full repaint
- Scrolling log region
- Large table
- Overlapping popup
- Unicode-heavy text
- Rapid resize

### Metrics

- Input-to-prepared-frame latency
- Input-to-write-complete latency
- Layout time
- Paint time
- Diff time
- Serialization time
- Bytes emitted
- Queue depth, queue latency, and high-water marks
- Full-repaint count
- Allocations per frame
- Peak memory
- Idle CPU usage
- Slow-sink behavior

Microbenchmarks for grapheme segmentation, text measurement, cell comparison,
and ANSI serialization remain useful, but they do not substitute for these
end-to-end scenarios.

The initial Criterion baseline measures Unicode text under every width policy
and 80 by 24 one-cell and full-repaint frame preparation. Deterministic tests
gate patch shape, while scheduled CI retains statistical reports as artifacts.

## Implementation Milestones

### Milestone 1: Workspace And Core Types

Status: implemented.

Deliver:

- Workspace manifests
- `arborui-core`
- Initial geometry, color, style, and cursor types
- Shared lint, formatting, MSRV, and documentation configuration

Exit criterion: lower-level crates can share stable value types without a
facade or backend dependency.

### Milestone 2: Text And Rendering Core

Status: implemented.

Deliver:

- `arborui-text`
- `arborui-render`
- Width policy
- Grapheme store
- Cell and buffer
- Canvas and surfaces
- Frame diff and prepared-frame transaction
- Headless render tests

Exit criterion: arbitrary frames can be painted, diffed, replayed, and verified
without a real terminal.

### Milestone 3: Terminal Contract And Backend

Status: initial implementation complete. PTY compatibility and Unix job-control
validation remain part of stabilization.

Deliver:

- `arborui-terminal`
- `arborui-backend-crossterm`
- Backend trait
- Normalized events
- Desired terminal state
- RAII session
- Alternate-screen mode
- Cursor management
- Suspend and resume

Exit criterion: a basic fullscreen renderer restores the terminal after normal
exit, application error, panic, resize, and suspension.

### Milestone 4: Layout And UI Tree

Status: initial implementation complete. The current correctness baseline
performs complete layout and painting; interaction is delivered in Milestone 5.

Deliver:

- `arborui-layout`
- `arborui-ui`
- Private Taffy adapter
- Ephemeral elements
- Retained identity
- Keys and reconciliation
- Paint, layout, and recomposition invalidation

Exit criterion: borrowed declarative views can be reconciled and rendered
without retaining unsafe references.

### Milestone 5: Interaction

Status: initial implementation complete. Runtime translation from terminal
events and the standard interactive widget catalog are delivered in Milestone 6.

Deliver:

- Event routing
- Hit testing
- Mouse capture
- Focus manager
- Keyboard navigation
- Hover and focus transitions after layout changes

Exit criterion: nested interactive widgets compose without global event
broadcasts or manual focus flags.

### Milestone 6: Runtime And Widgets

Status: implemented.

Deliver:

- `arborui-runtime`
- `arborui-widgets`
- `Application` and `Command`
- Event proxy
- Scheduler
- Standard widget set
- Controlled text input

Exit criterion: applications remain idle without rendering, integrate with
external async work, and can be fully tested headlessly.

### Milestone 7: Facade And Public Test Harness

Status: implemented. The facade exports a curated prelude, `arborui-test` drives
the real runtime and renderer through an in-memory terminal, the counter
workspace example verifies the downstream dependency boundary, and the Focus
Queue pilot exercises the broader interactive application surface.

Deliver:

- `arborui`
- `arborui-test`
- Prelude and feature structure
- Application examples
- Snapshot and event-injection APIs

Exit criterion: a downstream application can depend only on `arborui` and test
with `arborui-test` without importing backend implementation details.

### Milestone 8: Stabilization

Status: initial stabilization implemented. Terminal lifecycle failure recovery,
cross-platform PTY CI, bounded fuzz targets, benchmark baselines, package
contents, compatibility policy, and coordinated Cargo 1.90 release automation
are in place. Unix job-control integration and emulator-specific behavior
remain follow-ups. The complete `arborui` package family must be rechecked for
crates.io availability immediately before the first release.

Deliver:

- PTY CI matrix
- Fuzzing corpus
- Benchmark baselines
- API documentation
- Semver and MSRV policy
- Publishing automation
- Compatibility notes

Exit criterion: there are no known terminal-restoration failures, benchmark
regressions are tracked, and crate versions can be published in dependency
order.

### Milestone 9: Correctness Hardening

Status: implemented. Layout conversion uses cumulative absolute coordinates and
Taffy's edge-difference rounding, the terminal runtime and headless harness
recover from missed structural invalidation without dropping the triggering
event, and frame patches expose a validated atomic wide-grapheme contract.

Deliver:

- Cumulative layout rounding that prevents gaps and overlaps between adjacent
  fractional boxes
- Runtime recovery from a missed recomposition invalidation
- Documented and enforced continuation-cell invariants for frame patches
- Focused regression and property tests for each corrected invariant

Exit criterion: fractional layouts render without seams, a structural model
change cannot terminate the runtime solely because recomposition was not
requested, and third-party backends can implement frame patches without relying
on undocumented cell-run behavior.

### Milestone 10: Runtime And Terminal Resilience

Status: planned.

Deliver:

- Restore-first panic handling with documented unwind and abort behavior
- Unix stop, continue, and termination-signal integration
- Event-proxy wakeups that can interrupt blocked terminal polling
- Explicit contracts for fullscreen alternate-screen rendering and any future
  inline or native-scrollback modes
- Capability negotiation state covering queries, partial replies, timeouts,
  user overrides, downgrade, and renegotiation after resume
- Compatibility tests for tmux and representative terminal emulators
- Updated terminal lifecycle and compatibility documentation

Exit criterion: terminal restoration and external-event latency are reliable
across normal exit, errors, panics, suspension, and supported platforms; each
supported screen mode has explicit ownership and recovery semantics; and
capability transitions cannot leave terminal and backend state in disagreement.

### Milestone 11: Production-Scale Application Proof

Status: in progress. Focus Queue contains controlled modal editing, external
work, cancellation, settlement, recovery, and bounded observable ingress.
Collection Lab separately proves fixed and cached variable-height visible-range
construction, overscan, stable-key selection, collection focus, resize, and
bounded retained tree size through facade-only tests and benchmarks. A matched,
isolated Ratatui 0.30.2 package now proves semantic and character-frame parity,
bounded million-row construction, idle policy, expanded complete logical-turn
timings, production Crossterm serialization counts, isolated allocation and
  retained-memory measurements, ArborUI render-phase attribution, and
  full-reference-checked retained-layout, unchanged-frame, and damaged-row
  optimizations. A facade-only virtualized table workload adds responsive
  columns, Unicode cells, stable selection, resize, deterministic visible and
  offscreen producer updates, and a matched Ratatui `Table` baseline. A matched
  bounded scrolling-log workload now adds follow-tail and paused append policy,
  stable eviction anchoring, million-record bounded construction, and complete
  latency, output, phase, and memory probes. A reusable table control, select
  control, broader workload baselines, and the complete production-scale proof
  remain planned.

Deliver:

- A substantial facade-only application with multiple screens, overlays,
  asynchronous work, large collections, and realistic state transitions
- Application-driven improvements to the public API
- A virtualized collection prototype with visible-range construction, stable
  item identity, overscan, measurement, focus, and selection semantics
- Bounded and observable application ingress with explicit rejection,
  coalescing, or replace-latest policies and recoverable send errors
- Common application primitives such as checkbox, select, dialog or modal, and
  table support where the pilot demonstrates a need
- Layout additions justified by application requirements
- Semantic and accessibility metadata for interactive elements
- An end-to-end tutorial and deterministic application tests

Exit criterion: a non-trivial application can depend only on `arborui` and test
with `arborui-test` without extensive custom widget infrastructure or access to
implementation crates; large collections do not require constructing the
complete item subtree; and external producers cannot grow runtime queues
without a configured bound or observable pressure signal.

### Milestone 12: Performance Evidence And Incremental Work

Status: in progress. Milestone 11 established the first application-level
allocation, retained-memory, and phase-timing baseline. Whole-frame retained
layout reuse, unchanged-frame logical-content reuse, and conservative
full-width damaged-row repaint are now checked against a separately callable
full-layout/full-paint reference and improve the measured collection turns;
the matched table workload confirms bounded million-row turns and demonstrates
that offscreen model updates can reuse unchanged committed output. The matched
scrolling log confirms flat million-record turns and the same reuse for paused
producer appends. The completed matched overlay workload adds a stable stack,
opaque scrim, centered dialog, focus trap with wrap and restoration, pointer
isolation, exact character and semantic parity, normal and resize-open evidence,
production output counts, retained-memory measurements, and ArborUI phase
attribution. The completed matched Unicode
workload adds combining, CJK, ZWJ emoji, flag, variation-selector, and ambiguous
content; atomic wide-grapheme boundary clipping; wide-to-narrow replacement;
exact semantic and character parity through resize; and latency, production
output, retained-memory, and ArborUI phase evidence. Resize storms, live ingress,
and finer-grained incremental work remain open.

Deliver:

- Phase-level instrumentation for reconciliation, layout, paint, diff,
  serialization, backend write, queue latency, and full repaints before
  optimization work begins
- End-to-end benchmarks for large trees, tables, scrolling logs, overlays,
  Unicode-heavy content, resize storms, and background updates
- Measurements for latency, allocations, layout, painting, diffing,
  serialization, emitted bytes, and peak memory
- Reproducible baselines for the current implementation and comparable TUI
  applications
- A separately callable full-render reference path and generated comparisons
  between reference and optimized frames and patches
- Optimizations selected from measured bottlenecks, potentially including
  buffer reuse, text-measurement caching, retained layout state, clean-subtree
  skipping, damaged-row scanning, and run-level terminal serialization
- Tracked benchmark reports or regression thresholds

Exit criterion: performance claims are supported by reproducible
application-level data; optimization starts only after phase measurements are
available; and incremental work remains equivalent to the full-render reference
without rendering or transactional correctness regressions.

### Milestone 13: Release And Ecosystem Maturity

Status: planned.

Deliver:

- Dependency and security policy enforced through `cargo-deny` or equivalent
  auditing
- A documented decision on coverage reporting and CI enforcement
- Public API and semver review for the first release, separating application,
  widget-author, backend-author, and internal implementation surfaces
- Documented project ownership, review and release authority, succession, and
  security-response expectations
- A lightweight ADR process for resolving architecture questions before their
  answers become accidental public contracts
- Final crates.io availability, package-content, and coordinated publishing
  checks
- Stable backend contracts before an additional backend is introduced
- Compatibility, migration, support, and maturity policies

Optional macros, derive helpers, scoped tasks, alternate screen modes, and
additional backends remain application-driven follow-ups rather than release
requirements.

Exit criterion: users can evaluate adoption risk from documented guarantees,
supported extension surfaces and project ownership are explicit, and the
complete package family can be released reproducibly.

## Open Design Questions

The following decisions should be resolved through prototypes and architecture
decision records:

- Whether `Widget` is one trait or separate measure, paint, and event traits
- How event bindings map dynamic event data into typed messages
- Whether frame patches borrow cells or own encoded runs
- Whether the terminal contract splits input, output, and lifecycle traits
- Whether grapheme storage is global to a renderer or scoped to buffers
- How controlled and uncontrolled scroll state coexist
- Which crates support `no_std` or `alloc` without `std`

An open question must not be accidentally stabilized through a convenience
re-export or macro expansion before it is decided.
