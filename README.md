# yatui

`yatui` is an experimental Rust-native terminal user interface library. It is
being designed as a collection of focused crates for text processing,
rendering, layout, terminal integration, retained UI identity, application
runtime behavior, and widgets.

The project is in its initial implementation phase. The current code provides
shared core types, Unicode grapheme measurement, cell buffers, clipped drawing,
surface composition, transactional frame diffing, and a facade crate. The
remaining subsystems are developed incrementally.

## Design

Start with the [design document index](docs/README.md). The design covers:

- [Architecture and ownership](docs/architecture.md)
- [Workspace crate boundaries](docs/crates.md)
- [Rendering and Unicode text](docs/rendering-and-text.md)
- [UI and runtime behavior](docs/ui-and-runtime.md)
- [Terminal lifecycle](docs/terminal.md)
- [Testing and implementation roadmap](docs/testing-and-roadmap.md)

## Development

Install the repository tools and run the complete local check:

```console
pnpm install
just ci
```

The workspace MSRV is Rust 1.85.0 and is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
